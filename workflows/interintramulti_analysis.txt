1. Files with the users-by-communities (i.e. each line corresponds to a space-separated list of users in a community) with names

	communities*#_comp.txt

where * is the community type (one of {0, 1, ..., 10}) and # is the community detection algorithm used (one of {'' = OSLOM, 'i' = INFOMAP, 'WSBM_K2' = WSBM with K = 2, ...}) should be placed in the directory

	data/coverings/

2. Use compare_weights_inter_v_intra_community-NEW.py to partition the edges (and edge weights) into intra- and inter-edges (or also multi edges, for coverings as in OSLOM).

3. To analyze the weight distributions, use

	ecdf_distribution_by_community_type-coverings.R

or 

	ecdf_distribution_by_community_type-partitions.R

depending on whether the you are considering coverings of the nodes or partitions of the nodes.

%DIF > Community detection in online social networks is typically based on the analysis of the explicit connections between users, such as ``friends" on Facebook and ``followers" on Twitter. But online users often have hundreds or even thousands of such connections, many of which connect them with news outlets, governmental organizations, etc., in addition to their friends and associates. Because of the multifaceted nature of these networks, we claim that community detection in online social networks should be multifaceted, question-oriented and rely on additional information beyond the simple structure of the network. The concept of `community' is very general, and different questions such as ``whom do we interact with?" and ``with whom do we share similar interests?" can lead to the discovery of different and interesting social groups. In this paper we focus on three types of communities beyond follower-based structural communities: activity-based, topic-based, and interaction-based. We analyze a Twitter dataset using three different weightings of the structural network meant to highlight these three community types, and then infer the communities associated with these weightings. We show that interesting insights can be obtained about the true community structure of a social network by studying when and why these four different community types are disjoint and when they overlap. Community structure that would be missed if only doing a single layer of community detection.

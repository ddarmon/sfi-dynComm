@article{LancichinettiPlos,
	Abstract = {        <p>Community structure is one of the main structural features of networks, revealing
                    both their internal organization and the similarity of their elementary units.
                    Despite the large variety of methods proposed to detect communities in graphs,
                    there is a big need for multi-purpose techniques, able to handle different types
                    of datasets and the subtleties of community structure. In this paper we present
                    OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), the first method capable to
                    detect clusters in networks accounting for edge directions, edge weights,
                    overlapping communities, hierarchies and community dynamics. It is based on the
                    local optimization of a fitness function expressing the statistical significance
                    of clusters with respect to random fluctuations, which is estimated with tools
                    of Extreme and Order Statistics. OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement
                    procedure of partitions/covers delivered by other techniques. We have also
                    implemented sequential algorithms combining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so
                    that the community structure of very large networks can be uncovered. Our method
                    has a comparable performance as the best existing algorithms on artificial
                    benchmark graphs. Several applications on real networks are shown as well. OSLOM
                    is implemented in a freely available software (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oslom.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.oslom.org</ext-link>), and we
                    believe it will be a valuable tool in the analysis of networks.</p>

@article{Lancichinetti2009,
	Abstract = {Many networks in nature, society and technology are characterized by a mesoscopic level of
 organization, with groups of nodes forming tightly connected units, called communities or modules,
 that are only weakly linked to each other. Uncovering this community structure is one of the most
 important problems in the field of complex networks. Networks often show a hierarchical
 organization, with communities embedded within other communities; moreover, nodes can be shared
 between different communities. Here, we present the first algorithm that finds both overlapping
 communities and the hierarchical structure. The method is based on the local optimization of a
 fitness function. Community structure is revealed by peaks in the fitness histogram. The resolution
 can be tuned by a parameter enabling different hierarchical levels of organization to be
 investigated. Tests on real and artificial networks give excellent results.},

A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.},

Google Scholar Search "community detection twitter":

* http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-012-0074-8, Using dynamic community detection to identify trends in user-generated content

** Summary: They create a network of *terms*, rather than users, and detect communities within this 'topic' network.

* http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=35431&, Mutually Enhancing Community Detection and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Networks, from Journal of Data Analysis and Information Processing

** Summary: This is the closest paper (so far) to what we're trying to do. They did 'vanilla' community detection on a friend / follower network, and then 

** Key parts: 

*** "After the networks had been constructed, both the Infomap and SLPA algorithms were run to perform initial community detection before any additional features were added."

*** SLPA = SPEAKER-LISTENER LABEL PROPAGATION, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.5720.pdf

*** "Three types of features were used to augment the results of SLPA and Infomap on the initial friend/follower networks. These included: replies, mentions and retweets; hashtags; and sentiment classification of tweets. These features were computed for all of the 32 days in the dataset. Then, they were used to iteratively increment edge weights in the four social networks, and community detection was repeated on the networks using edge weights updated with each day’s data. Variations of this technique were attempted in order to determine optimal performance, such as cumulatively maintaining edge weight updates or resetting the network to the initial friend/follower network after computing communities with each day’s data."

*** The above quote shows that they did something very similar to what we plan to do. But they do a very simple weighting, incrementing an edge weight by 1 for each mention / retweet. How does this work to more 'sophisticated' approaches, like weighting by the fraction of mentions, etc.?

*** They use hashtags as an additional weighting, incrementing an edge weight whenever a two users have tweets that share a hashtag.

*** Also, they *start* with obvious communities (based on Twitter accounts run by Microsoft), whereas our network does *not* explicitly begin with any sort of community structure.

*** "This suggests that more meaningful communities were uncovered by updating network edge weights with the three supplementary feature types. Increasing weight values of edges connecting nodes with common features allowed community partitions that were likely more representative of the real world interactions in these networks to be discovered."

*** They are using day-by-day dynamic 'snapshots' of the network, and computing the modularity over time (once for each day).

*** They don't do *anything* in terms of content-free v content-full communities.

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0017, Identifying Topical Twitter Communities via User List Aggregation, unpublished

** Summary: They use Twitter's List feature to extract users who share common people on their lists. A very different approach to defining a community (i.e. a community is when people tend to aggregate the same people to follow).

* http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~kwanhui/2012-HT-twitterCommInt.pdf, Following the follower: detecting communities with common interests on twitter, in Proceedings of the 23rd ACM conference on Hypertext and social media

** Summary:

** Key Points:

*** "One important problem in the application of target advertising and viral marketing to online social networks is the efficient identification of communities with common interests. Current approaches involve detecting all communities, then determining the interests of these communities [2, 5]. These approaches involve a lengthy and intensive process of detecting communities for the entire social network and many of the detected communities may not share the interest we are looking for. We propose a method to identify communities comprising like-minded individuals with common interests on Twitter. Also, our method does not unnecessarily detect communities that do not share any specific interest."

*** That is, they are searching for a community of users who are a priori interested in a topic. This obviously differs from our approach, but is nevertheless interesting.

** Summary: 

** Key Points:

***  "We use the final user similarity computed in last section as well as classical clustering algorithms to identify communities. There are two well known cluster algorithms: hierarchical clustering and k-means. Hierarchical algorithm is too slow to handle large-scale dataset such as users in Twitter, whereas k-means is very fast and effective. So in this paper, we apply k-means to cluster users in Twitter."

*** Methodologically, they take a *very different approach*. Much more 'CS' that 'Math/Physics.' For example, they use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (a popular Bayesian model) to determine (latent) topics for the users based on their Tweet text, and then consider two users to be related if they share similar topics. (So-called 'text similarity,' where a distance is computed between two users' latent distribution.) They do the final 'clustering' using k-means, rather than a method that explicitly takes into account the topology of the network (like modularity-based methods, stochastic block models, etc.).

*** In general, they define a bunch of ad hoc similarities ('following similarity,' 'hashtag similarity,' 'retweet similarity,' etc.) and then use these to do a multidimensional clustering. The acceptance of the invention of ad hoc similarities is reassuring, given our plans to define ad hoc information weights.

** Summary: They explored the interplay between more static networks (like follower / friend) and 'topic networks' defined in terms of networks where links correspond to retweets and replies, and they show that people seem to follow someone after they've been mentioned (i.e. conversations lead to follower-ship, even if the conversation is just about a broad topic). They did this all through studying tweets related to the show *The X Factor*.

** Key Points:

*** This is a *really* rough paper. The fact that it got accepted into ICWSM makes me very hopeful for the fate of our paper.

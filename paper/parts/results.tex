\subsection{Community Statistics (? A better title should go here.)}

Discuss the basic properties of the various types of communities: distribution of sizes, number of singletons, etc.

\subsection{Comparing Community-Types with Normalized Mutual Information}

Because OSLOM detects \emph{coverings} rather than \emph{partitions} of users, standard cluster comparison methods like variation of information~\cite{meilua2003comparing} are not appropriate. Instead, we use a generalized variation of information measure, the normalized information, first introduced in~\cite{lancichinetti2009detecting}. \textbf{TK: Etc. Put more here about NMI, what it does, and how to interpret it.}

The normalized mutual information between the various community-types are shown in Figure~\ref{Fig-compare_coverings}.

\caption{The normalized mutual information between the communities using the different weightings. Weighting 0 corresponds to the structural (binary weighting) network, weightings 1 through 6 correspond to the weighting using the transfer entropy with lag 1 through 6, weighting 7 corresponds to the hashtag similarity, and weightings 8, 9, and 10 correspond to the mention, retweet, and mention-retweet weightings. Values of normalized mutual information close to 1 indicate similarity in the community structure, while values close to 0 indicate dissimilarity. The normalized mutual information is computed with the singletons removed.}

\subsection{Comparing Different Flows Across Different Community-Types}

\caption{An example of the edges considered in determining the edge weight distribution for a given community (the focal community is in yellow). We focus on the internal-to-internal (red), internal-to-external (green), and external-to-internal (blue) edges. For a given focal community, all other edges (grey) are not considered.}

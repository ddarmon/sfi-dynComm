*Revise section 3.4, 

*3.4 change title


Dave:

General
______
* Clear up that we are different than 44 addressing the comment “The method itself is not particularly new. It was used in the past in [44]. “


Introduction:
-------------

* "However, with the prevalence of large rich data sets for online social networks": I think that the opposite is actually true. Sociologists usually go beyond simple structure and/or structure is used to describe dynamics. 
[[This seems to be cleared up by you but please check]]

* Rewrite sections where we talk about collecting the network 'blindly' to highlight that we're proposing a multi-faceted view of users.

	* Weaken the statement about blindly. Make clearer the point that we're asking multiple questions at the same time, rather than anything about agnostic.

* Rewrite the sentence "many of these connections do not correspond to real friendships or more generally to accounts that users interact with" to incorporate something like "People in Twitter follow accounts that are not real friends, but news outlets, governmental organizations, etc."

* Change structural communities to follower-based structural communities.

* Give an example of how different weightings of a network might still result in the same community structure.


* "However, we conjecture": rightly, the authors say that this is just a conjecture. At the same time, very bold claims are based on this very simple conjecture. 
[[I can’t find what the reviewer is talking about so this might be done]]* "For example [6],": the idea of building a network based on this is not particularly new.* "However, this approach focused on data for a particular topic...": this is not a credible justification to dismiss the work. The fact that you present an approach based on structure together with this one does not represent a significant contribution per se in my opinion.[[We are not dismissing this work we are using it to say what we have done has been done before in a different context. We just need to make this more clear that this is not our contribution and that we are not dismissing this work.]]


Methods:
————
* “The discussion of the selection of the clustering algorithm can be summarized in my opinion.”
[[Not sure if you already did this or even what the reviewer is wanting]]


Results:
--------

* Rewrite the section around "For meaningful community structure, we expect the distribution of edge weights to differ with the edge type" to explain why we expect this to be the case, or when it might not be the case. Or remove the assumption of difference altogether.

* Rewrite the section around "But we have seen in our study that a structural network alone is not sufficient to capture user interaction or even activity-based influence in online social media." to emphasize how we get different communities from that of the follower network, and thus the follower network alone is not enough to elucidate these types of communities.



Make sure the following reviewer concerns have been addressed, I don’t think a lot needs to be done with these just more justification added really so that the reviewer is not as confused.

*The result in Figure 1 is not really significant. These are comparisons between different methods without a clear interpretation of the results.* "That is, the transfer entropy coverings are more similar...": These findings are not particularly insightful in my opinion. These might be just artifacts of the definitions.* Figure 2: I cannot se real insights from these plots.* For meaningful community structure...:: It is not clear to me why this should be the case. You can have in theory similar communities. This is probably not the case, but you should avoid to say that you expect this behaviour.* "If the community structure were arbitrary...": this is not true in general.* "Similarly, for the coverings corresponding to...": it is not possible to compare these results directly, since they represent very different properties. They are not really normalized/scaled up.* "This means that these accounts had high influence...": this is a strong claim. This might be simply due to the higher probability of retweet for that account, i.e., the use of the entropy transfer function might not necessary. The actual introduction of such a complex tool for describing this tool is not completely justified.* "Lastly, it is interesting to note...": the same might be true for these accounts.





Reviewer 2:
-----------

* Address the reviewer's final thought by saying something like "This is an interesting avenue of research, but beyond the scope of this paper. We focused on communities because ..."

* “Also, the similarity based on topics is not a contribution per se in my opinion. Topic extraction techniques (also in more refined ones, as cited by the authors) have been used in several papers.”
We never say that this is our contribution, we are simply using this as an example of a community or question. I think we just need to make this more clear that we are not trying to contribute this. One or two sentences should clear this up.

Method
———
* Section 2.5: the extraction of the weights is pretty standard, I do not consider this as a contribution per se.We aren't saying this is a contribution this is a method, we just need to make this more clear that we didn't come up with this, I think just adding citations or if we did come up with this stating that explicitly

Title
*Change to reflect new focus


Abstract
—————
*Rewrite to reflect new focus

Throughout
___________
[[Joshua Done]] Rewrite to focus on multifaceted rather than single questions. 

Introduction:
-------------

[[David Done]] "contact filtering": this is not a common term/concept at all in my opinion. It seems that tit has been introduce by the authors. [[Citation seems to be added]]

[[Joshua Done]] "On a more abstract level, a user might consider themselves part of a community of people discussing similar topics...": this is a standard approach to social network analysis. The membership is defined by the users themselves.

[[Joshua Done]] Change 'influence' to 'predictive ability' for transfer entropy sections. Use an acronym like PV-AC (predictive / activity). Reemphasize the information theoretic nature of transfer entropy.

[[Joshua Doneish]] Address how activity-based and interaction-based views of users differ.




Methodology:
------------



[[Joshua Done]] For this reason, we coarsen each time series by considering non-overlapping time intervals...": this time series might be rather sparse. A discussion of this issue might be helpful.
 [[Joshua, Done]]Rewrite the sentences surrounding "a positive value for the transfer entropy of the user" to be about predictive ability rather than influence.

[[Joshua Done]] "A positive value for the transfer...": this is just an assumption, you should say that you assume this.

Results:
--------
 [[Joshua, Done]] * Rewrite the section around "This means that these accounts had high influence in terms of their followers’ activity of Twitter" to be a statement about predictability rather than influence.

[[Elisa Done]] Find two or three users that are in very different communities when viewed from the framework of the different types of questions. Include this in a subsection called something like "A Case Study in a Multifaceted View of Users"

[[Elisa Done]] Change title of section 3.4 to something like 'Answering the Questions' to motivate that this is our attempt at answering the questions we posed in the beginning.

[[Elisa Done]] Give more motivation for Equations 2, 3, and 4.
[[Elisa Done]] Formulae (2) and (3): you should use a different symbol for p in (2) and (3).
[[Elisa Done]] In (4) the p can be very different. This formula is not correct in my opinion.Concl 
————
* [[Joshua Done]]“even activity-based influence": it depends, you can consider weights accordingly, for example based on the frequency/intensity of the interaction, etc. You can even add a weight using Granger correlation. You can put a weight if the correlation is higher than a certain given threshold for example - and only tnen apply the community detection algorithm.
* [[David done]] "erroneous results": how can you say that your resutls are corrects. [[Seems like this has been fixed as I can’t find it anymore but please check]]

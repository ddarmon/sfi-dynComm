Next actions:

* [[Complete]]Remove Table 2. (Josh)

* [[Complete]] Put Figure 4 back into the main text. (Josh)

* Mention *why* we mostly report on lag-4 TE: (Dave)
	** Add other lags to the ECDF plot.
	** In text, after we report on the ECDFs and NMIs, say something like 'from here on out, we use TE4'.

* Rethink title: (All)
	** Possible title: 'Followers Are Not Enough: A Question-Oriented Approach to Community Detection'

* Related to above: Comment on how the network collection was done in a more-or-less agnostic manner. (Dave)

* Also related to above: rework these sentence: (Elisa)

** 'All these methods begin with a given network, and then attempt to uncover structure present in the network, i.e., they are agnostic to how the network was constructed.'

to be more about the analysis you do with a already-collected network rather than how you collect the network.

** 'We then describe our methodology for constructing the question-specific networks.'

* Change the 'teenagers vs. elderly users' to something about activity profiles. (Josh)

* Move the references in the related works section to the introduction, and remove the related works section. (Elisa)

* Add some sentences about how information theoretic and social influence may be different, and we must be careful about how we interpret results related to TE. (Josh)

* [[Complete]] Add Aaron Clauset's WSBM paper to the list of community detection methods. (Josh)

* Rewrite the 'We see in Table 1...' text to make sense. (Dave)

* [[Complete]] Remove the asterisk from Table 5 and replace it with a $\cdot$ or just a space. (Elisa)

* Add a sentence to 'Next we consider the distribution of community sizes ...' section. (Dave)

* Change the edges in Figure 3 to be solid / dot / dash, to match the plots. (Dave)

* Fix the 'purple' / 'magenta' confusion. (Dave)

* Add an explanation for the use of E vs e wrt random variables vs their realizations. (Dave)

* Use $P(W_{u \to f} \leq w_{u \to f} | ...)$ in the definition of the cdf. (Dave)

* Clarify and make careful distinction between information theoretic and social influence wrt the sentence "Our findings have important implications..." (Josh)

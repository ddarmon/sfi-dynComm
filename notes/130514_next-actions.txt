Next Actions (13 May 2014):
===========================

Elisa:

E1. Rerun OSLOM with partitions rather than coverings.

E2. See if InfoMap communities can be improved.

E3. Rerun mention-retweet network construction using the first 3/4 of the data:

Start at 2011/4/25 9am and stop at 2011/5/23 9am.

Josh:

J1. Rerun transfer entropy network construction using the first 3/4 of the data:

Start at 2011/4/25 9am and stop at 2011/5/23 9am.

Do lag-4 transfer entropy first.

J2. Think about a good transfer entropy-specific question for question-oriented approach.

Dave:

D1. Continue with weighted stochastic block models:

	* Choose good parametric distributions for transfer entropy and hashtag networks.

	* Validate the choice of K using Bayes factors / cross-validation.

D2. Think about questions for topic / activity-based communities.

D3. Run the prediction problem with the new, time-truncated networks

All:

A1. Think about questions one might ask that would motivate the types communities we have decided on.

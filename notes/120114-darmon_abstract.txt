Communities play a central role in determining how users interact with online social media services. In many cases, the `social graph' for users on these services is at least partially known, and provides information about how users \emph{can} interact. However, this social graph does not capture how users \emph{actually} interact. In this paper, we investigate how augmenting the social graph of users with information about their online interactions reveals communities distinct from those determined using the social graph alone. Using data collected from fifteen thousand Twitter users over a nine week period, we examine how the definition of a community is problem-dependent, and demonstrate that different definitions reveal different communities. These findings highlight the importance of carefully framing questions regarding communities in online social networks, and emphasize the importance of going beyond the static social graph of users in social network analysis.

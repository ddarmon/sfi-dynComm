Some specific points:

8. Why is 'counting' in quotes?  This explanation of how the probabilities are calculated is not clear.

9. Eq. 7 is the same as Eq. 1: just with hats to show estimated values, this seems unnecessary.

10. For the activity-based communities, transfer entropy is used to weight the edges.  But, it is not explained why this is an appropriate choice for this task or why it should work well with the community detection algorithm.  Why is this a better choice over other approaches for learning structure in, for instance, the graphical lasso. It is also not explained why a network should be used to represent this at all, since the activity is a binary time series (post/no-post), so why not just use more standard clustering algorithms?

11. Eqs. 5 and 6 seem to suggest that the conditional probabilities are always the same as the (k+1)th time step conditioned on the FIRST k time steps.  While this is true, I think it should really be saying that it is equal to probability of any time step conditioned on the previous k steps. So, some clarification seems necessary.

12. Frequently the term "community" is misused, relative to accepted usages in the literature. For instance: "This type of information flow defines a community in a much different way than transfer entropy." But these methods are not defining a community, they are defining links. Communities are inferred using the community detection algorithm.

13. The topic-based communities section provides a good justification for using hashtags as a proxy for topics.

14. What is the purpose of the analysis in the section "Comparing Edges Across Different Community Types"?  It seems to be comparing the different networks with the communities found from those different networks, but it is not clear why this is being done. It seems that this comparison is used to justify or validate the approach, but this doesn't really tell us that the different types of communities are capturing different aspects of the data.

15. "We see in Table 1 that the topic- and interaction-based communities have the most singletons, with the activity based community dominating this measure." -- What does it mean to "dominate" the measure?

16. "non-structural networks" seems like an oxymoron. This is very confusing.

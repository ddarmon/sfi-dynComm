Notes from 291014:

Change title of section 3.4 to 'Answering the Questions' or something like that.

Elisa: Find two or three users that are in different types of communities depending on the type of community we look at.

A Case Study in Multifaceted View of User

Rewrite 'blindly' into a multi-faceted view of users.

Weaken the statement about blindly. Make clearer the point that we're asking multiple questions at the same time, rather than anything about agnostic.

Change 'influence' to 'predictive ability ' for transfer entropy sections. Use an acronym like PV-AC (predictive / activity)

Remove pM and pR from the interaction-based section.

Change structural communities to follower-based structural communities.

Reviewer 2: This is beyond the scope of this paper. We focused on community detection...

Give example for how two different weightings could give the same community structure.

General Topic
=============

What types of communities are we interested in, and what methods do we think will pick them out?

* Structural: Any standard community detection algorithm.

* Topics: Some sort of weighting by hashtags (count up the number of shared hashtags between users and weight the edge between them accordingly).

* Conversational: Either the mention/retweet weighting or (maybe) the transfer entropy weighting might might pull these out.

* Behavioral: Mutual information would pick this up. We can return to some of our results from the summer school work.

How should we deal with timescales with the transfer entropy?

* Two sorts of 'timescales':

** How we decide to coarsen the time series (from 1s resolution to something coarser).

** How far back we look in time to compute the transfer entropy.

* Initial approach: choose a reasonable time resolution (1 hour), and try various time lags and see how the weights change.

How to think of transfer entropy

* Transfer entropy isn't *really* about conversations, but as its other name (transfer information) implies, about *information* flow. People might influence each others behaviors without them 'conversing.'

Community Detection Algorithm:

* Many options.

* Disjoint or overlapping communities?

** Overlapping makes the most sense in a social setting.

* Many or one community detection algorithm?

** Focus on one.

How will we measure the goodness-of-fit of our community detection algorithm?

* This is a hard problem in general.

* For modularity-based methods, you can just cite the modularity.

** While this is a general practice, it may not be the best approach. See, for example, this paper by Clauset et al:

* We can at least compute the variation of information between the structural and content-free/content-full communities to show that they *do* (or don't) differ.

* Elisa's idea: use something like the convergence time for a consensus clustering algorithm, with the intuition that the longer it takes to converge, the less meaningful the clustering.

To Do
=====

By Thursday, December 12:

* {G} Dave: Write intro for content-free communities / transfer entropy.

* {G} Dave: Get out the hashtags used by all of the users.

* {G} Elisa: Perform a literature review on directed, weight-based community detection algorithms that allow for overlapping communities.

* {G} Elisa: Begin to try out the algorithms on the networks weighted by mention / reply / retweet data.

* {G} Josh: Integrate Elisa, Dave, and Josh's code.

* {G} Josh: Begin doing a 'parameter sweep' for the transfer entropy approach to decide on a coarsening parameter and a lag parameter.

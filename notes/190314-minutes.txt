Near Term Tasks for Paper:
==========================

0. Investigate a few papers from each of the three journals listed above to determine the most appropriate venue for *our* paper.

Everyone

1. Write up, in more detail, the methodology for Transfer Entropy.

Dave / Josh

2. Motivate *why* we think Transfer Entropy provides a useful weighting for community detection, beyond novelty.

Dave

3. Put back in and expand qualitative analysis of the communities.

Elisa

4. Add a 'qualitative' (really, just more in-depth) analysis of the transfer entropy communities:

** Which individuals have the highest transfer entropy into / out of a particular community? Does this make sense?

** Rank users in the community by their transfer entropy, giving something like a 'most influential person' ranking of the users.

** More along these lines.

Everyone, especially with regards to brainstorming questions to ask

5. Expand on / clarify / determine a better metric for the 'links within / across communities' section.

Dave

6. arXiv the paper 'as is.'

* Before this, return the paper to non-ICWSM LaTeX format.

Dave

7. Add a list of the reviewer comments to GitHub, and pick them off as we go.

Everyone
